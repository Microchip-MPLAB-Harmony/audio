      void      DSP_VectorZeroPad(int32 *indata, int N)

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    dsp_vector_zero_pad.S

  Summary:
    Fills an input vector with zeros.

  Description:
    Fills the first N values of an input vector INDATA with the value zero.  N
    must be a multiple of 4 and greater than 4 or will be truncated to the nearest
    multiple.  The vector result is in Q31 fractional format.

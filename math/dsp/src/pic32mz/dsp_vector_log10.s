  DSP_VectorLog10:

      void DSP_VectorLog10(_Q3_12 *outVector, _Q16 *inVector, int N)

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    dsp_vector_log10.S

  Summary:  
    Computes the Log10(x), of the first N elements of inVector, and
    stores the result in outVector.

  Description:  
    Computes the Log10(x) value, on the first N elements of inVector.  The output is
    stored to outVector.  Input vector is _Q16 format, which is 32-bit data with
    15 bits for the integer and 16 bits for the fractional portion.  The output
    vector is reduced resolution Q3.12 format, which is a 16-bit integer format
    with 12 bits representing the fractional resolution.
    If values exceed maximum or minimum they will saturate to the maximum
    or zero respectively.

  Notes: 
    This function uses the Microchip PIC32MZ LIBQ library to function.  The user
    must include that library and header file into the design in order to operate
    this function.  For more information on the Log10 function see the LIBQ documentation
    for _LIBQ_Q3_12_log10_Q16.
    A negative number input will return a saturated negative value (0x8000).

# 1284 (variable) clock cycles for a 4 element 32bit data vector
# 2048 (variable) clock cycles for a 8 element 32bit data vector

# Input Parameters
# $a0 - outVector pointer, data for scalar Exp function

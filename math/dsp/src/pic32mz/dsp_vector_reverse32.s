      void      DSP_VectorCopyReverse32(int32_t *outdata, int32_t *indata, int N)

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    dsp_vector_reverse32.S

  Summary:  
    Reverses the order of elements in one vector and copies them into another.

  Description:  
    Fills the first N values of an input vector Outdata with the the reverse elements
    from INDATA.  N must be a multiple of 4 and greater than 4 or will be
    truncated to the nearest multiple of 4.  The vectors are both Q31 fractional format.

      void DSP_VectorLog2(_Q5_10 *outVector, _Q16 *inVector, int N)

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    dsp_vector_log2.S

  Summary:  
    Computes the Log2(x) of the first N elements of inVector, and stores the
    result in outVector.

  Description:  
    Computes the Log2 value, where log2(x) = ln(x) * log2(e), on the first N elements of
    inVector.  The output is stored to outVector.  Input vector is _Q16 format,
    which is 32-bit data with 15 bits for the integer and 16 bits for the fractional
    portion.  The output vector is reduced resolution Q5.10 format, which is a
    16-bit integer format with 10 bits representing the fractional resolution.
    If values exceed maximum or minimum they will saturate to the maximum
    or zero respectively.

  Notes:
    This function uses the Microchip PIC32MZ LIBQ library to function.  The user
    must include that library and header file into the design in order to operate
    this function.  For more information on the Log2 function see the LIBQ documentation
    for _LIBQ_Q5_10_log2_Q16.

#
# 972 (variable) clock cycles for a 4 element 32bit data vector
# 1608 (variable) clock cycles for a 8 element 32bit data vector
#   requires more cycles for negative numbers
#
# Input Parameters
# $a0 - outVector pointer, data for scalar Exp function
# $a1 - inVector pointer
# $a2 - N, output vector end address
# $a3 - 

# $t0 -

# $t5 -
# $t6 -

# Assumption: Function does not save the stack prior to external call, but stores
#    critical loop values in $s0 and $s1.  Tested for interference with calling function.

/*******************************************************************************
Microchip DSP Library
    Bartlett (Triangle) Windows on Vector

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    dsp_transform_window_bartlett.c

  Summary:
    Perform a Bartlett window on a vector.

  Description:
    Compute a Bartlett (Triangle) Window on the first N samples of the input vector, InVector.
    The output is stored in OutVector.  Operations are performed at higher resolution
    and rounded for the most accuracy possible.  Both 16-bit and 32-bit functions
    are provided.  Input and output values are in Q15 fractional format and Q31
    fractional format respectively. 
    The Bartlett Window follows the equation:

       Window(n) = 1 - (abs(2*n - N)/N)
         where n is the window sample number
         N is the total number of samples
    The functional output computes WinVector(n) = Window(n) * InVector(n)

   Notes:
    This function is performed in C.  The function may be optimized for the library.
    It is dependent on the floating point math library.

      void      DSP_VectorFill(int32 *indata, int32 data, int N)

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    dsp_vector_fill.S

  Summary:
    Fills an input vector with scalar data.

  Description:
    Fills the first N values of an input vector INDATA with the value DATA.  N
    must be a multiple of 4 and greater than 4 or will be truncated to the nearest
    multiple.  The vector result and the scalar value to fill are both Q31
    fractional format.

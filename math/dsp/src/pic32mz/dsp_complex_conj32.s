      void  DSP_ComplexConj32(int32c *indata, int32c *Output)

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    dsp_complex_conj32.S

  Summary:
    Calculates the complex conjugate of a complex number.

  Description:
    Calculates the complex conjugate of Indata, and stores the result in Outdata.
    Both numbers must be in the complex number data structure which includes real
    and imaginary components. Values are in Q31 fractional data format. The
    function will saturate the output if maximum or minimum values are exceeded.

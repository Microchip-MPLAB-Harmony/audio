      void DSP_ComplexSub32(int32c *indata1, int32c *indata2, int32c *Output)

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    dsp_complex_sub.S

  Summary:
    Calculates the difference of 2 complex numbers.

  Description:
    Calculates the difference of 2 complex numbers, Indata1 less Indata2, and 
    stores the complex result in Output.  Both numbers must be in a complex data 
    structure which includes real and imaginary components.  Function saturates
    the output values if maximum or minimum are exceeded. Real and imaginary
    components are in Q31 fractional data format.

      void DSP_ComplexScalarMult32(int32c *indata, int32 Scalar, int32c *Output)

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    dsp_complex_scalar_mult.S

  Summary:
    Multiplies a complex number and a scalar number.

  Description:
    Multiplies a complex number Indata by a scalar number, Scalar, and stores
    the result in Output. Indata and Output must be in int32c structure with
    real and imaginary components. All data must be in fractional Q31 formats.
    The function will saturate if maximum or minimum values are exceeded.
    Output(real) = (Input1.re * Scalar);
    Output(img) = [(Input1.im * Scalar)]i

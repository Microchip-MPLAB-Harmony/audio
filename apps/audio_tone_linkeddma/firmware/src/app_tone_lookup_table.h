  Summary:
    This header file provides prototypes and definitions for the application.

  Description:
    This header file provides function prototypes and data type definitions for
    the application.  Some of these are required by the system (such as the
    "APP_Initialize" and "APP_Tasks" prototypes) and some of them are only used
    internally by the application (such as the "APP_STATES" definition).  Both
    are defined here for convenience.

  Function:
    void APP_TONE_LOOKUP_TABLE_Initialize(void);

  Summary:
     MPLAB Harmony application initialization routine.

  Description:
    This function initializes the Harmony application.  It places the
    application in its initial state and prepares it to run so that its
    APP_Tasks function can be called.

  Precondition:
    All other system initialization routines should be called before calling
    this routine (in "SYS_Initialize").

  Parameters:
    None.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    APP_SDCARD_AUDIO_Initialize();
    </code>

  Remarks:
    This routine must be called from the SYS_Initialize function.

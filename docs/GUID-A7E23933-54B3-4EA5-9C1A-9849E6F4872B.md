## C

```c
int32_t FLAC_GetBlockSize(void);
```

## Summary
        Blocksize represents the number of samples in any of a block's subblocks. 
        For example, a one second block sampled at 44.1KHz has a blocksize of 44100, regardless of the number of channels. 
        This function returns that value.

## Description

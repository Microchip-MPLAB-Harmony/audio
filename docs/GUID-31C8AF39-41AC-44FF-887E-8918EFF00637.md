# ADPCM Encoder Library

## _Introduction_

Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) is a royalty-free audio codec. 
It is a lossy compression standard. It is a variant of Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (DPCM). 
The file format used to contain an ADPCM files, is the same as WAV.
Its popularity comes because it achieves compression of 4 to 1 but does not require high processing power.
Typical applications using ADPCM are for speech. 

This implementation currently supports 16 bit stereo.

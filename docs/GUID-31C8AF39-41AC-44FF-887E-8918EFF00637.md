## *Introduction*

Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation \(ADPCM\) is a royalty-free audio codec. It is a lossy compression standard. It is a variant of Differential Pulse-Code Modulation \(DPCM\). The file format used to contain an ADPCM files, is the same as WAV. Its popularity comes because it achieves compression of 4 to 1 but does not require high processing power. Typical applications using ADPCM are for speech.

This implementation currently supports 16 bit stereo.

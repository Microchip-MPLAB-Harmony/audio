# PCM Encoder Library

## _Introduction_

The PCM encoder is a royalty-free audio codec. It is a lossless standard and there is no compression.
It can typically be used to share speech; share music; create files to playback by older/slower processors. 

This implementation currently supports 16 bit stereo. The sample rate can vary widely.

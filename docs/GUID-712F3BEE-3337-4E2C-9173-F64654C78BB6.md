# ADPCM Decoder Library

## _Introduction_

Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) is a royalty-free audio codec. It is a lossy compression standard. It is a variant of Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (DPCM). The file format used to contain an ADPCM files, is the same as WAV. Decoding is fast and requires little processing power.

Typical applications using ADPCM are for speech. This implementation currently supports 16 bit stereo.
